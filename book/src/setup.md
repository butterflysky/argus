Start here, then dive into the subpages for details:

- [Installation](setup-installation.md) — drop the jar, generate `config/argus.json`, and fill it.
- [Discord Application](discord-setup.md) — create the bot, enable intents, collect IDs.
- [Configuration](configuration.md) — field-by-field reference and in-game config commands.
- [Whitelist Behavior & Safety](setup-behavior.md) — how enforcement works with whitelist on/off, cache, and fallbacks.
